# filling-in-shapes
This repository contains code for a shape-filling AI.
- `generating-shapes.py`: code for creating shapes in the dataset (squares, rectangles, ellipses, circles, stars, filled circles/dots, lines/not closed shapes).
- `training-model.py`: code for training a UNet-style neural network on the data.
- `prediction.py`: code for displaying predictions on a folder of images.
- `model-weights.h5`: file hosting the weights of the trained UNet model.
10k and 25k sample versions of the dataset were uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/washingtongold/filling-in-shapes?select=10k-sample-dataset-w-identical-io).
